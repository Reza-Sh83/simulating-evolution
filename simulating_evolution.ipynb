        "\n",
        "- <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**No Progress or Perfection**</span>: This definition says nothing about \"progress\" or \"perfection.\" Any change in traits over time counts equally as evolution.\n",
        "- <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**No Complexity Requirement**</span>: Gain or loss of a trait both equally count as evolution.\n",
        "- <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Timeframe**</span>: Evolution can happen over short or long periods of time. Both count equally as evolution.\n",
        "- <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Population Size**</span>: Evolution can happen within small populations or in whole species.\n",
        "- <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Mechanisms**</span>: Change in characteristics need not necessarily be due to natural selection to count as evolution (e.g., genetic drift).\n",

        "## <span style=\"color: #2E86C1;\">Main Mechanisms for Evolution</span>\n",
        "\n",
        "Several mechanisms can produce evolution. The most common are:\n",
        "\n",
        "### <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">1. Natural Selection</span>\n",
        "Change in a trait because it increased or decreased fitness (fitness is usually measured as the number of surviving offspring). A trait will evolve by natural selection if and only if **three criteria** are met:\n",
        "1. <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Variation**</span>: The trait varies in a population.\n",
        "2. <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Heritability**</span>: The trait is inherited from parents to offspring.\n",
        "3. <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Selection**</span>: The trait non-randomly alters the fitness of organisms that carry it.\n",
        "\n",
        "> <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">**Fitness**</span> is a measure of how well an individual can pass on its genes to the next generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Neutral Traits**: Traits that do not affect fitness are called **neutral traits** or **selectively neutral traits**. These cannot evolve by natural selection unless they become non-neutral due to environmental or organismal changes.\n",

        "- Substitution of **single nucleotides**.\n",
        "- Insertions, deletions, or rearrangements of longer stretches of DNA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if these changes do not affect *fitness*, mutation itself may still change some traits. Mutation rates in nature are generally very low, so mutation is considered a slow mechanism of evolution. However, mutation can combine with natural selection to generate rapid trait changes.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### <span style=\"color: #E74C3C;\">3. Genetic Drift</span>\n",
        "If populations were infinitely large, chance would play no role in evolution. However, all real populations have a limited number of individuals, so **sampling effects** can influence evolution. The smaller the population, the more powerful genetic drift will tend to be.\n",

We will represent the **frequency** of allele A1 with the variable A1 and the frequency of allele A2 with the variable A2.

        "When we simulate the spread of the resistant allele (R) in a bacterial population under antibiotic treatment, the following scenarios can occur based on the input parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Scenario 1: Initial Conditions**\n",
        "   - The simulation starts with 10% resistant bacteria (f_R = 0.1) and 90% susceptible bacteria (f_S = 0.9).\n",
        "   - The resistant allele has a fitness advantage (W_R = 1.0) compared to the susceptible allele (W_S = 0.5).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scenario 2: Selection Pressure in Favor of R**\n",
        "   - The resistant allele frequency increases generation by generation because R confers an advantage in an environment with antibiotics.\n",
        "   - The susceptible allele (S) becomes less common due to reduced survival and reproduction rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scenario 3: Fixation of R**\n",
        "   - Over time, R becomes dominant in the population, approaching a frequency of 1.0 (fixation), while S is almost entirely eliminated.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scenario 4: No Change in Frequencies**\n",
        "   - If W_R = W_S, there would be no selection. Both alleles would maintain their initial frequencies over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Scenario 5: Selection Against R**\n",
        "   - If W_R < W_S, the resistant allele would decrease in frequency, eventually being outcompeted by the susceptible allele.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Insights:\n",
        "- The strength of selection (difference in W_R and W_S) directly impacts how quickly R becomes fixed in the population.\n",
        "- The initial frequency of the resistant allele (f_R) determines how long it takes for R to dominate.\n",
        "- If the fitness values are equal, no evolutionary change occurs.\n",

Several solutions proposed at the time -- like Darwin's notion (following Lamark) that the environment modified an organisms genetics and those changes could be inherited -- were tested and abandoned.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **modern synthesis** in the 1930s combined Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection with **mutation** as the source of biological variation, and inheritance following the **genetic** rules of inheritance derived from Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance in pea plants.\n",

Diploid organisms, as we noted above, by definition have two copies of each chromosome. Because all genetic information is encoded on a physical chromosome, this implies that diploid organisms have two copies of each allele (I am ignoring for the moment some important exceptions like sex chromosomes). During sexual reproduction, one copy comes from each parent.\n",

Organisms that have two copies of the same allele -- like individuals that are RR or SS -- are called *homozygous* because they have the same (*homo*) allele on each chromosome. RS organisms are called *heterozygous* because they have different (*hetero*) alleles on the two chromosomes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Under certain simplifying assumptions, called **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium** it is possible to predict the frequency of each genotype given the frequency of the alleles that compose it. If the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium hold for a set of two alleles at the same locus in a diploid organism, and if $p$ represents the frequency of the allele $A_1$ and $q$ represents the frequency of allele $A_2$, then the frequencies of the genotypes will be:\n",

        "\n",
        "## Modelling how genotypes translate into phenotypes\n",
        "\n",
        "Critically, selection does not act on the genotype directly. Instead, that genotype -- in interaction with its environmental context -- is translated into a phenotype or set of realized characters . The way in which different genotypes translate into phenotypes is called the **mode of inheritance**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For our purposes of modelling selection in diploids, we care most about how the fitness values $W_{pp}$, $W_{pq}$ and $W_{qq}$ differ under different modes of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dominance** -- The simplest type of inhertiance - the one first discovered by *Gregor Mendel* in pea plants - is called Complete Mendelian Dominance. In this mode of inheritance, one allele is dominant over another. In heterozygotes, the dominant allele determines the phenotype. In our above example if R were dominant to S, then RS heterozygotes would show the phenotype -- the same level of antibiotic resistance -- as RR individuals - even though they only have one R allele. Because RS and RR individuals both show the same phenotype, we would expect them to have the same fitness. So if R showed complete Mendelian Domiance over S, we would expect $W_{pp}$ == $W_{pq}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other modes of inheritance are described below:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recessive** -- heterozygotes show the same phenotype as homozygotes for the other allele. So if R is recessive to S, then RS heterozygotes would be identical to SS homozygotes, and so be susceptible to the antibiotic. Therefore we expect $W_{pq}$ == $W_{qq}$ (the opposite of Dominance)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Incomplete Dominance** -- in incomplete dominance, RS heterozygotes show an intermediate phenotype between RR and SS. If we observe $W_{pp}$ > $W_{pq}$ > $W_{qq}$ we can rule out a purely dominant or recessive trait (since in that case $W_{pq}$ == $W_{pp}$ or $W_{pq}$ == $W_{qq}$), and might instead suspect incomplete dominance or codominance (below)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Codominance** -- if two alleles are co-dominant, then heterozygotes show a mosaic or patchwork of both phenotypes. For example, for an allele governing color codominance might result in a patchy pattern.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is far from an exclusive list of patterns of inheritance, but it should at least help to illustrate how Mendelian inheritance works. It is worth noting at this point that the above is a useful simplification - in reality more complex patterns of inheritance are possible, and an organisms environment (not just its genetics) can influence how many genotypes translate into phenotypes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "Diploids have two copies of each genetic variant or **allele**. The set of alleles is called the **genotype**. These genotypes often map to phenotypes -- the actual observed traits of the organism -- following a pattern of inheritance (dominant, recessive, incomplete dominance or codominance). **Natural selection acts on phenotypes not genotypes**, so if we want to understand fitness we have to also understand how genotypes translate into phenotypes.\n",

        "To review, we previously calculated how selection would change the frequency of allele R in haploids by multiplying the frequency of the R genotype by its fitness and then dividing by the same for each allele.  Now we will do the same again- the only trick is that now there are 3 possible genotypes (RR, RS, or SS) and 3 possible fitnesses $(W_{rr}, W_{rs}, or W_{ss})$ instead of just 2 possible genotypes (R or S) and 2 possible fitnesses $W_r$  and  $W_s$.\n",

        "### Key Observations:\n",
        "1. **Initial Conditions**:\n",
        "   - We start with an initial allele frequency of $p$ (A1) = 0.2 and $q$ (A2) = 0.8.\n",
        "   - Fitness values for the three genotypes are set as:\n",
        "     - $W_{pp}$ (A1A1 homozygotes): 0.6\n",
        "     - $W_{pq}$ (A1A2 heterozygotes): 1.0\n",
        "     - $W_{qq}$ (A2A2 homozygotes): 0.5\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Selection Effects**:\n",
        "   - Over time, the allele frequency of A1 ($p$) changes due to differential fitness values.\n",
        "   - Heterozygotes (A1A2) have the highest fitness ($W_{pq} = 1.0$), indicating a scenario of **overdominance**, where the heterozygote has a selective advantage over both homozygotes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Equilibrium**:\n",
        "   - As generations progress, $p$ and $q$ approach an equilibrium state where the changes in allele frequency stabilize.\n",
        "   - This equilibrium represents the balance point where the effects of selection maintain a stable allele frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Impact of Fitness Values**:\n",
        "   - If $W_{pp} > W_{pq}$, allele A1 would increase in frequency faster, eventually leading to fixation (p = 1.0).\n",
        "   - Conversely, if $W_{qq} > W_{pq}$, allele A2 would dominate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary:\n",
        "The results illustrate how allele frequencies change over generations in diploid populations under selection. The mode of inheritance and fitness differences between genotypes determine the rate and direction of allele frequency changes. This highlights the importance of genotype-phenotype mapping and selection in evolutionary dynamics.\n"

        "### Simulation Overview:\n",
        "We simulated the evolution of an antibiotic resistance allele in both haploid and diploid organisms under the same selection pressures.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Parameters:\n",
        "1. **Diploid Organisms**:\n",
        "   - Fitness of A1A1 homozygotes ($W_{pp}$): 1.0\n",
        "   - Fitness of A1A2 heterozygotes ($W_{pq}$): 1.0\n",
        "   - Fitness of A2A2 homozygotes ($W_{qq}$): 0.50\n",
        "   - Initial allele frequencies: $p = 0.1$ (A1), $q = 0.9$ (A2)\n",
        "   - Generations simulated: 200\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Haploid Organisms**:\n",
        "   - Fitness of A1 ($W_p$): 1.0\n",
        "   - Fitness of A2 ($W_q$): 0.50\n",
        "   - Initial allele frequencies: $p = 0.1$ (A1), $q = 0.9$ (A2)\n",
        "   - Generations simulated: 200\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Results:\n",
        "1. **Comparison of Frequencies**:\n",
        "   - The frequency of allele $q$ decreases over time in both haploids and diploids, but the rate of decrease differs.\n",
        "   - Diploids exhibit a slower decline in $q$ frequency compared to haploids.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Differences in Evolutionary Dynamics**:\n",
        "   - A key factor contributing to this difference is that diploids have heterozygotes (A1A2) that can partially mask the effects of selection, slowing the fixation of beneficial alleles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "Ploidy significantly influences the evolutionary trajectory of antibiotic resistance alleles. In diploids, heterozygotes act as a buffer, slowing the impact of selection. This results in different dynamics compared to haploids, where allele frequencies shift more rapidly due to direct selection on phenotypes.\n",

That means that given the same exact parameters (same pop. size, same allele frequency, same selective regime, etc) evolution has taken a slightly different course in each population.

        "In our simulation the true cause is what's called a sampling effect: while the probability of getting an $A_1A_1$ phenotype when crossing two $A_1A_2$ heterozygotes is 0.25, if we only have 4 offspring it will be fairly common for 0,1,2,3 or even 4 of them to be $A_1A_1$. So the *observed* count of $A_1A_1$ can be anywhere from 0-100%, even though the *expected* frequency is exactly 1. The same thing happens at a population level:  _when the number of observations is anything less than infinite the observed counts for each genotype won't perfectly match the expected counts of each genotype._ But it is the observed genotypes (i.e. the ones that actually occur in the organisms) that will be passed on to the next generation. Therefore this process changes allele frequencies."

        "\n",
        "### Key Concept:\n",
        "Natural selection and genetic drift are two forces driving evolution. Genetic drift is a stochastic process that affects allele frequencies in small populations, while selection favors certain alleles due to their fitness advantage. This simulation combines both processes to study how allele frequencies evolve under these interacting forces.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simulation Parameters:\n",
        "- **Fitness Values**:\n",
        "  - $W_{pp}$: Fitness of genotype $A_1A_1$.\n",

        "1. **Selection Effects**: If one allele has higher fitness, its frequency increases over generations.\n",
        "2. **Drift Effects**: Fluctuations in allele frequencies occur, especially in smaller populations.\n",
        "3. **Combined Effects**: Selection generally dominates in larger populations, while drift may obscure selection effects in smaller populations.\n"

        "Nearly neutral theory suggests that alleles subject to weak selection ($s \\ll \\frac{1}{N_e}$, where $N_e$ is the effective population size) behave as if they are effectively neutral. This means that the fixation rates of these alleles are primarily driven by genetic drift, rather than selection.\n",

        "#### Key Concepts:\n",
        "- **Effectively Neutral Alleles**:\n",
        "  - When the selection coefficient ($s$) is much smaller than $\\frac{1}{N_e}$, selection is too weak to influence allele frequencies significantly.\n",
        "  - These alleles are subject to drift, and their fixation or loss is random.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Testing the Prediction**:\n",
        "  - The simulation varies population sizes ($N_e$) and tracks the fixation rates of an allele with a weak selection coefficient ($s = \\frac{1}{10}$).\n",
        "  - It categorizes populations where $s < \\frac{1}{N_e}$ as effectively neutral and those with $s \\geq \\frac{1}{N_e}$ as subject to selection.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Fixation Rate**:\n",
        "  - The proportion of simulations where the allele becomes fixed (reaches a frequency of 1.0).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Observations:\n",
        "1. For small populations (where $N_e$ is small), alleles with $s \\ll \\frac{1}{N_e}$ behave neutrally, with fixation rates close to the expectation for neutral alleles.\n",
        "2. As population size increases, selection becomes stronger relative to drift, and fixation rates deviate from neutral predictions.\n",
        "3. Fixation rates in neutral vs. selected cases are plotted against population size, illustrating the transition from drift-dominated to selection-dominated regimes.\n",
